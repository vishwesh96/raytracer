 * The image2cam transformation is similar to the modeling-viewing pipeline transformation that opengl

 *
 * The cam2world transformation is set to identity by default. This is the WCS to VCS transform. 
 *
 * Must ensure that this is called at least once with valid parameters, before the camera can 
 * act as a producer of primary rays.
